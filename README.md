# 2048 Game CI/CD Pipeline on AWS

## üå•Ô∏è Project Overview
#### This project demonstrates how to set up a complete CI/CD pipeline to deploy a Dockerized version of the 2048 game on AWS using ECS with Fargate. It covers:

- Building and pushing a Docker image of the 2048 game to Amazon ECR

- Setting up AWS CodePipeline to automate the build and deployment process

- Deploying the container to Amazon ECS using the Fargate launch type

- Containerized the app and deployed to Amazon ECS with Fargate

- Reduced manual steps and ensured fast, reliable deployments


#### üßπ Clean-up Resources
To avoid incurring unnecessary AWS charges:

###### Delete CodePipeline:
- Navigate to the AWS CodePipeline Console and delete the pipeline.

###### Delete CodeBuild Project:
- Go to the CodeBuild Console and remove the project.

###### Remove IAM Roles/Policies:
- Delete roles and policies created for CodeBuild and CodePipeline.

###### Delete S3 Bucket:
- Remove the bucket used for storing build artifacts if no longer needed.

###### Delete ECR Repository:
- Go to the ECR Console and delete the image repository.

###### Delete ECS Services and Cluster:
- Remove ECS services and the cluster (e.g., 2048-game-cluster, 2048-service) from the ECS Console.
